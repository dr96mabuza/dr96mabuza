## About
Hi there, I am a software developer from Gauteng, South Africa, and I taught myself how to do it. I'm currently studying at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and also at [WeThinkCode_](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/).

At [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), I'm always learning about [full stack Javascript web development](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript). It's a free online school that lets anyone anywhere learn to code. It has really made me love coding and solving problems.

At [WeThinkCode_](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/), I'm learning lots of different languages, topics, tools, and frameworks. This is making me a well-rounded developer who can work in any environment and in software engineering. [WeThinkCode_](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/) is a free school in South Africa that wants to help more people get into tech, especially those who might not normally have the chance.
